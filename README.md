# ShinyApp_kroger27
In This Repository I have created a simple shiny applications that displays closing stock prices for companies from the year 2010 to present/current date.
The application constantly update itself automatically on the current, so it does matter date you selected between 01-01-2010 to the current date of when you used the app it will provide you a the closing stock of the company of your choice.
The finding will then plot on a graph the date range to see the performance of that stock.
Another function of this application is it provides a small summary which shows the user the least, maximum and average stock of that that company based on the date range you selected.
